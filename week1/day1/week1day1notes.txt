What is Automation ?
   ->Automation can basically help to reduce the manual efforts which is
     mechanically repeating
   ->It can save lot of time
   
Why Java?What is Java?
    Java is a programming language
	Java is the predominantly used language in Selenium
	It has lot of libraries
	It is open source 

JDk:
====
   Java Development Kit->JRE+JVM
   JRE-Java RunTime Environment
   JVM-Java Virtual Machine
IDE:
===
   Integrated Development Environment
   
   
	
	
	
   
   





How to create a Maven Project?
=============================
   File->New->Project->Maven->Maven Project->Next>Click Create Simple project
   Checkbox->Next->Group Id->Artifact Id->Finish
   
What is a package?
    ->It is a folder to organize all your codes
	->Naming Convention for a package->start with LowerCase 
	->make it meaningful
How to create a package?
=======================
   -Right Click ->src/main/java->New->Package->name of the package->Finish

Class:=
======
    Class is a testcase->Techically Class is a java file
What can be inside a class?
     ->Constructor
     ->methods
     ->variables
Classroom:
==========
 -Create a new package(week1.day1)
 -Create a new class(FirstCode)
 -Create a main method using shortcut
 -write a syso statement as This is my FirstCode
 ->Print in the console
 
Method:
=======
   ->It is an action
   ->method is a smaller line of code that does some specific operations
   ->lowerCase and the next word should be in upperCase(CamelCase)

Syntax:
=======
   1)access modifier
   2)return type
   3)name
   4)input arguments
  This is method signature
  
How to create a method inside a class?
======================================
   1)type methodName ->ctrl+space->Enter->
   2)Write a print statement inside a method block

How to create an Object:
========================
  ->Object is a reference 
  -Classname objectName=new Classname();
   

Classroom:
==========
    Create a class Mobile
	Create methods
	   -sendSms
	     print some text message
	   -takeSnapShot
	     print some text message
	Create an object and execute from another class	 
  
Primitive datatypes:
===================
    int
	short
	long
	float
	double
	boolean
	char

Access modifier:
===============
   It specifies who can access and who cannot
   
   public   - anyone can access
      It is accessible by any classes inside the package and outside the package
   private  - Only you can access
       It is accessible by only that class
   protected
      
   default
      It is accessible by any classes within the package
	  Outside the package default methods are not accessible
	  
Global variable;
===============
  It belongs to all the methods

Local Variable:
================
   It is accessible only inside that methodName

Classroom:
==========
Create a class Calculator
create a method
   sub(void)
   mul(int a,int b)
    put a return statement
Create a main method
Create an object and access all the methods
Print in the console
