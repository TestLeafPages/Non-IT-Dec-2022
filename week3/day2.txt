Inheritance
Inheritance is a concept where building relation between 2 similar class(parent to child)
common function
duplicate 
reduce code
Types:
Single inheritance father extends grand father
Multilevel inheritance--I extends father extends grand father

java class by default extends object class

ClassRoom 3:
Class GrandParent ---three methods(house)
Class Parent---two method(house)
Class child---one method(house)

create obj in child class and check the hierarchy

Polymorphism
refers to ability of a class to provide different implementation of a method
same action in different way
poly----Many
morphs---form
Types:
overloading

Static polymorphism/compile time 
two or more method methods in same class different of argument and different data type
java exampl:
subString(start index)
subString(start index,end index)
Indexof(int ch)
Indexof(String,index)
Selenium:
frame(index);
frame(id/name);
frame(WebElement)

overriding
Dynamic polymorphism/RunTime polymorphism

same method name same argument but different class
when 2 or more methods are with in different class
but inherited between them
signature is same
but logic is different

sub class method overriding that from parent class
